			<h2>Stone Giant</h2>
			<p>
			    Coming to life as a chunk of stone, Tiny's origins are a mystery on which he continually speculates. He is a Stone Giant now, but what did he used to be? A splinter broken from a Golem's heel? A shard swept from a gargoyle-sculptor's workshop? A fragment of the Oracular Visage of Garthos? A deep curiosity drives him, and he travels the world tirelessly seeking his origins, his parentage, his people. As he roams, he gathers weight and size; the forces that weather lesser rocks, instead cause Tiny to grow and ever grow.

			    以一团石头的形式出现的生命体，小小不断思索他的起源，但这始终是个谜。现在的他是个石巨人，但过去是什么呢？从土傀儡的脚后跟掉落的碎片？从制造石像鬼的工房被打扫出来的碎屑？神圣预言石的表层之砂？受到强烈的好奇心驱使，他不知疲倦的环游世界，寻找着他的起源，他的出身，和他的种族。在旅途中，他变得越来越庞大，不过路上的风雨吹打掉了他身上的石头，所以他不停的吸收新的岩石，永远在长大。

			<h2>Spectre</h2>
			<p>
			    Just as higher states of energy seek a lower level, the Spectre known as Mercurial is a being of intense and violent energy who finds herself irresistibly drawn to scenes of strife as they unfold in the physical world. While her normal spectral state transcends sensory limitations, each time she takes on a physical manifestation, she is stricken by a loss of self--though not of purpose. In the clash of combat, her identity shatters and reconfigures, and she begins to regain awareness. She grasps that she is Mercurial the Spectre--and that all of her Haunts are but shadows of the one true Spectre. Focus comes in the struggle for survival; her true mind reasserts itself; until in the final moments of victory or defeat, she transcends matter and is restored once more to her eternal form.

			    和所有强大的能量都喜欢欺凌弱小一样，被称为墨丘利的幽鬼也是一个拥有着强横能量的存在，同样的，她对现实世界中的冲突和纷争无比着迷。然而她平时的幽鬼形态超越了常人的感知范围，因此每当她以实体形态出现时，她不得不损失一部分自我能量——尽管她也不愿意。在战斗中，她的自我意识逐渐散落并重新聚合，她也开始有了意识。她意识到了自己是幽鬼墨丘利——其他所有的鬼影都只是她自我的阴影。出于重新凝聚的打算，她开始专注，她的心智也在不断的成熟。只有等到她取得胜利或者彻底失败时，她那超物质的形态才会得以重聚。

			<h2>Ancient Apparition</h2>
			<p>
			    Kaldr, the Ancient Apparition, is an image projected from outside time. He springs from the cold, infinite void that both predates the universe and awaits its end. Kaldr is, Kaldr was, Kaldr shall be...and what we perceive, powerful as it appears to us, is but the faintest faded echo of the true, eternal Kaldr. Some believe that as the cosmos ages and approaches its final moments, the brightness and power of Kaldr will also intensify--that the Ancient Apparition will grow younger and stronger as eternity's end draws nigh. His grip of ice will bring all matter to a stop, his image will cast a light too terrible to behold. An Apparition no longer!

			    卡德尔，极寒幽魂，是时光之外的冰冷投影。他来自寒冷的无尽虚空，目睹宇宙诞生，见证宇宙终结。卡德尔是夕在，今在，永在的无上力量...我们的所有认知，所有自认为正确的强大的事物，在永恒的卡德尔看来，不过是最细微最无力的附和。有人相信，随着宇宙的老化并走向衰亡，卡德尔的力量和光芒也将变得更强——极寒幽魂将更加年轻，更加强大。他对冰霜的控制能够冻结一切事物，他的投影放出的光芒异常夺目。他将不再是幽魂，而是神!
